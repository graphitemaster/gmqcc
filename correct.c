/*
 * This is a very clever method for correcting mistakes in QuakeC code
 * most notably when invalid identifiers are used or inproper assignments;
 * we can proprly lookup in multiple dictonaries (depening on the rules
 * of what the task is trying to acomplish) to find the best possible
 * match.
 *
 *
 * A little about how it works, and probability theory:
 *
 *  When given an identifier (which we will denote I), we're essentially
 *  just trying to choose the most likely correction for that identifier.
 *  (the actual "correction" can very well be the identifier itself).
 *  There is actually no way to know for sure that certian identifers
 *  such as "lates", need to be corrected to "late" or "latest" or any
 *  other permutations that look lexically the same.  This is why we
 *  must advocate the usage of probabilities.  This means that instead of
 *  just guessing, instead we're trying to find the correction for C,
 *  out of all possible corrections that maximizes the probability of C
 *  for the original identifer I.
 *
 *  Thankfully there exists some theroies for probalistic interpretations
 *  of data.  Since we're operating on two distictive intepretations, the
 *  transposition from I to C. We need something that can express how much
 *  degree of I should rationally change to become C.  this is called the
 *  Bayesian interpretation. You can read more about it from here:
 *  http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/statistics/bayestutorial.pdf
 *  (which is probably the only good online documentation for bayes theroy
 *  no lie.  Everything else just sucks ..)  
 * 
 *  Bayes' Thereom suggests something like the following:
 *      AC P(I|C) P(C) / P(I)
 * 
 *  However since P(I) is the same for every possibility of I, we can
 *  completley ignore it giving just:
 *      AC P(I|C) P(C)
 *
 *  This greatly helps visualize how the parts of the expression are performed
 *  there is essentially three, from right to left we perform the following:
 *
 *  1: P(C), the probability that a proposed correction C will stand on its
 *     own.  This is called the language model.
 *
 *  2: P(I|C), the probability that I would be used, when the programmer
 *     really meant C.  This is the error model.
 *
 *  3: AC, the control mechanisim, an enumerator if you will, one that
 *     enumerates all feasible values of C, to determine the one that
 *     gives the greatest probability score.
 * 
 *  In reality the requirement for a more complex expression involving
 *  two seperate models is considerably a waste.  But one must recognize
 *  that P(C|I) is already conflating two factors.  It's just much simpler
 *  to seperate the two models and deal with them explicitaly.  To properly
 *  estimate P(C|I) you have to consider both the probability of C and
 *  probability of the transposition from C to I.  It's simply much more
 *  cleaner, and direct to seperate the two factors.
 *
 *  Research tells us that 80% to 95% of all spelling errors have an edit
 *  distance no greater than one.  Knowing this we can optimize for most
 *  cases of mistakes without taking a performance hit.  Which is what we
 *  base longer edit distances off of.  Opposed to the original method of
 *  I had concieved of checking everything.     
 *  
 * A little information on additional algorithms used:
 *
 *   Initially when I implemented this corrector, it was very slow.
 *   Need I remind you this is essentially a brute force attack on strings,
 *   and since every transformation requires dynamic memory allocations,
 *   you can easily imagine where most of the runtime conflated.  Yes
 *   It went right to malloc.  More than THREE MILLION malloc calls are
 *   performed for an identifier about 16 bytes long.  This was such a
 *   shock to me.  A forward allocator (or as some call it a bump-point
 *   allocator, or just a memory pool) was implemented. To combat this.
 *
 *   But of course even other factors were making it slow.  Initially
 *   this used a hashtable.  And hashtables have a good constant lookup
 *   time complexity.  But the problem wasn't in the hashtable, it was
 *   in the hashing (despite having one of the fastest hash functions
 *   known).  Remember those 3 million mallocs? Well for every malloc
 *   there is also a hash.  After 3 million hashes .. you start to get
 *   very slow.  To combat this I had suggested burst tries to Blub.
 *   The next day he had implemented them. Sure enough this brought
 *   down the runtime by a factor > 100%
 *
 *   The trie initially was designed to work on all strings, but later it
 *   became aparent that not only was this not a requirement. It was also
 *   slowing down get/sets' for the trie.  To fully understand, only
 *   correct_alpha needs to be understood by the trie system, knowing this
 *   We can combat the slowness using a very clever but evil optimization.
 *   By Setting a fixed sized amount of branches for the trie using a
 *   char-to-index map into the branches. We've complelty made the trie
 *   accesses entierly constant in lookup time.  No really, a lookup is
 *   literally trie[str[0]] [str[1]] [2] .... .value.
 * 
 * 
 * Future Work (If we really need it)
 *
 *   Currently we can only distinguish one source of error in the
 *   language model we use.  This could become an issue for identifiers
 *   that have close colliding rates, e.g colate->coat yields collate.
 *
 *   Currently the error model has been fairly trivial, the smaller the
 *   edit distance the smaller the error.  This usually causes some un-
 *   expected problems. e.g reciet->recite yields recipt.  For QuakeC
 *   this could become a problem when lots of identifiers are involved.
