Release v0.2.4
    * Preprocessor:
        - __VA_ARGS__ support
        - Predefined macros like __DATE__, __TIME__, ...
          (check the manpage for a full list)
        - Signed numbers as single token in the
        - Fixes some issues with #if operations on macros.
    * Language:
        - Untyped `nil` keyword.
        - Removed the `noreturn` keyword.
        - Added generic attribute syntax and reintroduced `noreturn`

          expressions. Eg: (3 * v).y
        - Type restricted variadict parameters:
          ie: void print(string...);
        - Accessing varargs from QC via: ...(index, type)
    * Compilation:
        - Various optimizations and progs-size reductions.
        - A new spell-checking algorithm tries to hint you at existing
          variables on error.
        - Some problems with VM related vector-instructions issues
          have been solved in both DP and our own executor. A new
          compatbility option (enabled by default) has been added for
          now: -flegacy-vector-maths
    * qcvm:
        - Improved commandline argument handling.
        - More builtins: sqrt(), normalize()
    * Commandline:
        - Support for making individual warnings an error
        - via -Werror-<warning>
        - added --add-info
