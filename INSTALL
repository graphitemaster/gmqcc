                           Installing gmqcc

1. Prerequisites
    - A C-Compiler such as gcc or clang
    - GNU Make. This document will assume GNU-Make to be executed via
      `make'. On BSD systems you probably have to use `gmake' instead.

2. Compilation
    Run the GNU make program `make' or `gmake'.

        make

    If no error appears, the following binary files will have been
    created:
        - gmqcc
        - qcvm

3. Installation
    The `install' target will install the 2 binaries to /usr/local/bin
    by default.
    The Makefile honors the following variables:

        - DESTDIR: The installation directory root.
        - PREFIX:  The installation prefix, default: /usr/local
        - BINDIR:  Directory for binary executables,
                   deafult: $PREFIX/bin

    To install to /usr/local run:

        make install

    To install to /usr run:

        make PREFIX=/usr install

    To install to a package-staging directory such as $pkgdir when
    writing a build script file:

        make DESTDIR=$pkgdir install
