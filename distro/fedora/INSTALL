File is constantly updated!

Since Fedora 19 we have this package in main repos. Please use it!

For install gmqcc do this:
# yum install gmqcc

For install qcvm do this:
# yum install qcvm

To use the spec files in this fedora directory you need the core
development tools , building enviroment for the user, and
the directory structure for it. If you don't already have these, issue
the following commands.

# yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
# yum install rpmdevtools
$ rm -rf ~/rpmbuild
$ rpmdev-setuptree

Prepare and build the RPMs.

$ cp gmqcc.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
$ wget https://github.com/graphitemaster/gmqcc/archive/0.2.9.tar.gz -o ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/gmqcc-0.2.9.tar.gz
$ wget https://raw.github.com/graphitemaster/gmqcc/master/distro/archlinux/release/build_fix.patch -o ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/build_fix.patch
$ rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/gmqcc.spec

Now we have RPMs in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/ and you can install it via yum.
